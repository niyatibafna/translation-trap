# Introduction

This repo contains the code our paper: **The Translation Trap Hypothesis:  Multilingual Generation with Large Language Models Suffers from Implicit Translation Failure** (arXiv coming soon!) 

# Getting started

See:

* `scripts/get_intermediate_generations.py` : Generating full sequences from intermediate layers with logit lens and greedy decoding.
* `scripts/characterizing_intermediate_generations.py` : Extracting relevant information such as accuracy and language of generations at various layers.
* `scripts/analysis/overview_analysis.py` : Calculating TLP and other quantities of interest.
* `experiments` : Example shell scripts for generation and analysis with two models.
